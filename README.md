<h3><strong>Functional Units of 8085:</strong></h3>

<h3>

1. Registers: These are nothing but set of flip flops. These are basically used to hold (store) the data.
General purpose registers–  8085 microprocessors contain 6 general purpose registers that are present inside the microprocessor and stores 8-bit data in order to execute a program.
These general purpose registers are B, C, D, E, H and L. These registers can be combined to form pairs – BC, DE and HL in order to execute the 16-bit operation.
These are programmable registers, that means these registers are accessed by the programmer to insert and transfer the data by making use of instructions.

Temporary registers: These registers are used by the ALU to store the data on temporary basis and these are not accessed by the programmer. These are of 2 types:

Temporary data register – It is an 8-bit register that holds the operand and provides it to the ALU for program execution. Also, the immediate results are stored by the ALU in this register.
W and Z register – These registers are also used to hold the temporary values. It is used by the control section of the microprocessor so as to store the data during operations.

2. Program Counter (PC): It is basically a special purpose register that is used to store the memory location of the instruction to be performed. As it is clear that in order to fetch an instruction from the memory the microprocessor needs to know about its address.It is a 16-bit register as it stores address. This register is used by the microprocessor to line up the instructions that are to be executed in a sequential manner.It functions in such a way that it fetches the opcode from one memory location and simultaneously get incremented by the next memory location. Thus, it provides sequencing of the program to be executed.

3. Stack Pointer (SP): It is also a 16-bit register and is a part of memory. The data is stored in the stack in serial format and stack pointer generally stores the address of the last data element stored in the stack. Thus the stack is based on LIFO.
Whenever a new data is added in the stack, then the stack pointer starts pointing towards the very next memory location.
As against, when a data element is removed from the stack, then the stack pointer points to previous occupied memory location.

4. Accumulator: It is an 8-bit register that stores the result of the operation performed by the ALU. It is also known as register A.

5. Flags: Flag register basically holds the status of the current result generated by the ALU and not the actually generated result. Thus we can say it is used to test the data conditions.

8085 has 5 flags that shows 5 different data conditions. These are carry, sign, zero, parity and auxiliary carry flags.
However, the mostly used are: sign, carry and zero.</h3>


<h3>Applications of 8085 microprocessor</h3>

<h3>
8085 finds its major applications in programmable calculators as well as in numerical control and environment monitoring systems. These are also used in switching, 
banking and financial systems.</h3>
