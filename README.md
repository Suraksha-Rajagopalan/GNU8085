<h3><strong>Functional Units of 8085:</strong></h3>


1. Registers: These are nothing but set of flip flops. These are basically used to hold (store) the data.
General purpose registers–  8085 microprocessors contain 6 general purpose registers that are present inside the microprocessor and stores 8-bit data in order to execute a program.
These general purpose registers are B, C, D, E, H and L. These registers can be combined to form pairs – BC, DE and HL in order to execute the 16-bit operation.
These are programmable registers, that means these registers are accessed by the programmer to insert and transfer the data by making use of instructions.

Temporary registers: These registers are used by the ALU to store the data on temporary basis and these are not accessed by the programmer. These are of 2 types:

Temporary data register – It is an 8-bit register that holds the operand and provides it to the ALU for program execution. Also, the immediate results are stored by the ALU in this register.
W and Z register – These registers are also used to hold the temporary values. It is used by the control section of the microprocessor so as to store the data during operations.

2. Program Counter (PC): It is basically a special purpose register that is used to store the memory location of the instruction to be performed. As it is clear that in order to fetch an instruction from the memory the microprocessor needs to know about its address.It is a 16-bit register as it stores address. This register is used by the microprocessor to line up the instructions that are to be executed in a sequential manner.It functions in such a way that it fetches the opcode from one memory location and simultaneously get incremented by the next memory location. Thus, it provides sequencing of the program to be executed.

3. Stack Pointer (SP): It is also a 16-bit register and is a part of memory. The data is stored in the stack in serial format and stack pointer generally stores the address of the last data element stored in the stack. Thus the stack is based on LIFO.
Whenever a new data is added in the stack, then the stack pointer starts pointing towards the very next memory location.
As against, when a data element is removed from the stack, then the stack pointer points to previous occupied memory location.

4. Accumulator: It is an 8-bit register that stores the result of the operation performed by the ALU. It is also known as register A.

5. Flags: Flag register basically holds the status of the current result generated by the ALU and not the actually generated result. Thus we can say it is used to test the data conditions.

8085 has 5 flags that shows 5 different data conditions. These are carry, sign, zero, parity and auxiliary carry flags.
However, the mostly used are: sign, carry and zero.


<h3>Applications of 8085 microprocessor</h3>


The Intel 8085 microprocessor, despite being an older 8-bit architecture, has found various applications over the years. While it has been largely replaced by more advanced microprocessors in modern computing, it is still used in some specific applications due to its simplicity, low cost, and ease of implementation. Here are some of the applications of the 8085 processor:

1. Embedded Systems: The 8085 microprocessor is used in various embedded systems and control applications, where the processing power of modern microprocessors is not required. Its low power consumption and simple architecture make it suitable for controlling simple tasks in devices like industrial control systems, home automation, and automotive electronics.

2. Educational and Learning Purposes: The 8085 microprocessor is often used in educational institutions to teach the fundamentals of microprocessor architecture and programming. Its straightforward instruction set and architecture make it an excellent choice for learning the basics of microprocessors and assembly language programming.

3. Legacy Systems: In some cases, the 8085 microprocessor is still used in legacy systems that were developed several decades ago. Replacing the microprocessor in these systems may be costly and impractical, so they continue to operate with the original 8085 chip.

4. Hobbyist Projects: Electronics enthusiasts and hobbyists may use the 8085 microprocessor in their projects due to its availability and ease of use. It can be used in various DIY projects, retro computing, and vintage gaming systems.

5. Control and Instrumentation: The 8085 microprocessor can be found in certain control and instrumentation systems, such as traffic signal controllers, digital multimeters, and basic measurement devices.

6. Medical Devices: Some medical devices, particularly older models, may incorporate the 8085 microprocessor in their designs for basic data processing and control functions.

7. Automation: In some manufacturing and automation systems, the 8085 microprocessor is used for simple control tasks where advanced processing power is not necessary.

It's important to note that while the 8085 microprocessor continues to find application in certain areas, its usage has significantly diminished compared to modern microprocessors like those from the x86 family or ARM architecture. These modern processors offer higher performance, more advanced features, and better energy efficiency, making them more suitable for most current computing needs.
